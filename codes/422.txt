title: Unprocessable Entity

    ".NET HTTP Status Enum": "HttpStatusCode.UnprocessableEntity"

The server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a [415 Unsupported Media Type](/415) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a [400 Bad Request](/400) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions.

For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.
